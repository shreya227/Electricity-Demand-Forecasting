This peoject investigates electricity demand forecasting for Delhi by conducting a comparative analysis of three modeling techniques: Prophet, stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, and hybrid Bidirectional LSTM Unidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM–LSTM) architecture. A high-resolution, multivariate dataset was constructed by scraping 5-minute interval electricity load (in megawatts) data from the State Load Dispatch Centre and resampling to 15-minute intervals and by integrating synchronized weather parameters (temperature, apparent temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, dew point, sea-level pressure, solar irradiance) via WeatherBit API, along with public holiday indicators. The preprocessing including timestamp alignment, range validation and a three-stage imputation pipeline (linear interpolation, weekday-based averaging, forward/backward fill) ensured data integrity and consistency. Prophet served as an interpretable baseline, modeling trend and multiple seasonalities with rapid training and clear decomposition plots. The stacked LSTM leveraged gated memory cells over 48 step windows to capture complex temporal dependencies, while the hybrid BiLSTM–LSTM extended this by processing sequences bidirectionally over 96 steps and refining them with a unidirectional LSTM layer. All models were evaluated on chronological train/validation/test splits using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R² metrics. The results demonstrate that while Prophet effectively captured broad patterns but struggled with abrupt demand shifts and the stacked LSTM improved accuracy yet remained sensitive to spikes, the BiLSTM–LSTM hybrid achieved the lowest forecast errors and highest explanatory power. These findings underscore the superiority of bidirectional deep learning architectures in modeling high-frequency load dynamics. By offering a scalable, end-to-end forecasting framework, this work delivers actionable insights for energy utilities, enabling enhanced demand-side management, dynamic pricing, and integration.

#### CONCLUSION

A comprehensive assessment of the three forecasting techniques provided deep insights into their effectiveness for high-frequency electricity demand prediction in Delhi. The Prophet model demonstrated moderate forecasting capability with a test MAE of 608.24 MW and a MAPE of 14.24%, efficiently capturing broad seasonal and holiday-driven variations but underperforming during sudden non-linear demand shifts. The stacked LSTM model marginally improved performance, achieving a test MAE of 605.48 MW and a MAPE of 14.45%, benefiting from its temporal sequence learning but remaining sensitive to abrupt consumption spikes. In contrast the hybrid BiLSTM–LSTM architecture outperformed both, attaining a substantially lower test MAE of 154.18 MW and an outstanding MAPE of 3.45%, effectively modeling complex, rapid and sequential load variations using its bidirectional and sequential memory structure. The results underline that while interpretable models like Prophet are valuable for understanding broad consumption trends, they are insufficient for handling the volatility typical of modern urban energy systems. Deep learning approaches, especially the BiLSTM–LSTM hybrid, proved superior in learning intricate temporal patterns shaped by exogenous factors. Residual analysis confirmed the minimal bias and tighter error distributions of the hybrid model, while convergence patterns reflected consistent learning and strong generalization capability across training, validation and test sets. This research holds significant operational importance for energy utilities and policymakers aiming to optimize power procurement, enhance smart grid stability. By delivering accurate, granular and context aware forecasts, the developed models facilitate dynamic load balancing, peak management, and seamless integration of renewable energy sources. The end-to-end scalable forecasting pipeline proposed in this study can be effectively adapted to other metropolitan regions, supporting broader goals of energy efficiency and resilient urban infrastructure development.
